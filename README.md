# Customer-Churn-Prediction
Processed and analysed customer Behavior data to build a logistic regression model with 82% accuracy. Identified key churn indicators and presented actionable strategies to reduce customer attrition.

📌 Project Objective

To build a machine learning model that predicts whether a customer is likely to churn based on their behavior and profile data.

🧰 Tools & Technologies

Python

Pandas, NumPy

Matplotlib, Seaborn

Scikit-learn

📂 Dataset

Telco Customer Churn Dataset Available on Kaggle

🔍 Key Steps

Data Cleaning: Converted categorical values, handled missing data.

EDA: Explored customer behavior patterns.

Feature Engineering: One-hot encoded categories and scaled numeric features.

Model Building: Used Random Forest Classifier.

Evaluation: Measured accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score.

📊 Insights

MonthlyCharges, Tenure, and Contract Type are key indicators.

Customers with month-to-month contracts and high monthly charges tend to churn more.

✅ Results

Model: Random Forest

Output: Classification report & confusion matrix
