![Graph](https://github.com/aadarshjaiswalvns/Data-Analytics-Portfolio/blob/main/Customer_Churn_Prediction.png) <!-- (Optional: Add a screenshot of your dashboard here) -->

## 📊 Project Overview
Processed and analyzed customer behavior data to build a machine learning model with **82% accuracy**.  
Identified key churn indicators and presented actionable insights to reduce customer attrition.

---

## 📌 Project Objective

To build a machine learning model that predicts whether a customer is likely to churn based on their behavioral and profile data.

---

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies

- **Python**
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

---

## 📂 Dataset

- **Source:** [Telco Customer Churn Dataset – Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/blastchar/telco-customer-churn)
- Contains demographic info, customer services, billing, and churn status

---

## 🔍 Key Steps

1. **Data Cleaning**
   - Converted categorical variables
   - Handled missing and inconsistent values

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Uncovered patterns related to churn behavior

3. **Feature Engineering**
   - One-hot encoded categorical features
   - Scaled numeric variables

4. **Model Building**
   - Trained using **Random Forest Classifier**

5. **Model Evaluation**
   - Evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix

---

## 📊 Insights

- **Monthly Charges**, **Tenure**, and **Contract Type** are strong indicators of churn.
- Customers on **month-to-month** contracts and with **higher monthly charges** are more likely to churn.
- Annual contracts help reduce churn rates significantly.

---

## ✅ Results

- **Model:** Random Forest Classifier
- **Accuracy:** ~82%
- **Outputs:** Classification report, confusion matrix, feature importance
